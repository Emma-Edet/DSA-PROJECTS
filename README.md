## DSA-PROJECTS

### PROJECT TOPIC : 
AMAZON CASE STUDY

#### PROJECT OVERVIEW :
In this Data Analysis Project in the AMAZON Case Study
the use of Basic Hands on Excel Functions were employed
to clean my data set to a more user friendly and not so
overly populated spreadsheet. It was done in such a way
that the Pivot Table could be readable and the contents
of the Dashboard or Report will not over-bloated. Hence,
it helped to enhance easy analysis of the data presented.
