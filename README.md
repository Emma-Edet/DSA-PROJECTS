## DSA-PROJECTS

### PROJECT TOPIC : 
AMAZON AND KMS CASE STUDIES

#### PROJECT OVERVIEW :
In this Data Analysis Project for the AMAZON Case Study
the use of Basic Hands on Excel Functions were employed
to clean my data set to a more user friendly and not so
overly populated spreadsheet. It was done in such a way
that the Pivot Table could be readable and the contents
of the Dashboard or Report will not over-bloated. Hence,
it helped to enhance easy analysis of the data presented.

Contrastingly, in the KMS Case Study all that was done 
was the use of SQL Queries to answer some analytical 
questions. The solutions from these analysis idealistically 
will help both the analyst and stakeholders make key decisions 
that could influence the overall growth of the company.
